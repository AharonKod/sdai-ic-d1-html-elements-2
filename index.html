    <h2>The Golden Spiral: A Journey into the Fibonacci Foodtruck</h2>

    <!-- You use a p tag for paragraphs -->
    <p>The Fibonacci Foodtruck is not just a name, but a symbol of the harmonious blend of mathematics and culinary art.
        The name Fibonacci was inspired by the famous Italian mathematician, Leonardo of Pisa, also known as
        Fibonacci. He introduced the Fibonacci sequence to the Western world in his 1202 book “Liber Abaci”. This
        sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, has found applications in various fields,
        including art, architecture, and nature.</p>
